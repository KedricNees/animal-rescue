      <h1>Education for Emus</h1>
          <p>The emus are in decline and we need your help. Over the years the emu population has been decreasing quickly because of poachers. It is horrible what humans
            are doing to these poor creatures. But it's not over yet. We dont have to stand around and let these poor animals die off. We can do something about it. If you
          purchase a book from "coolawesomebooks.com" 10% of your purchase will be spent to help save the emus!</p>
