      <p>The Tasmanian emu was hunted as a pest. In addition, the practice of setting fire to grassland and shrubland to aid in claiming land for agriculture deprived the birds of habitat.
        It is known that in 1838, two skin specimens were received by the British Museum. In 2018 the Austrian Natural History Museum in Weina displayed a taxidermed Tasmanian Emu.
        The subspecies became extinct around 1850. The history of emu introductions on Tasmania
         is not sufficiently documented to allow a more precise dating of the disappearance of diemenensis.</p>

      <h2> Cassowary Emu </h2>
          <div class="button"><a href="index.html">Go Back</a></div>
      <p>Cassowaries feed mainly on fruit, although all species are truly omnivorous and will take a range of other plant food, including shoots and grass seeds,
       in addition to fungi, invertebrates, and small vertebrates.
      Cassowaries are very shy, but when provoked they are capable of inflicting injuries, occasionally fatal, to dogs and people.</p>

        <div class="rheas">
        <h2> Rhea Emu </h2>
            <div class="button"><a href="index.html">Go Back</a></div>
        <p>The rheas are native to South America, distantly related to the ostrich and emu. There were formerly two, but now three species:
           the greater or American rhea, the lesser or Darwin's rhea and the puna rhea.
           The greater and puna rheas are currently rated as near-threatened in their native ranges, while Darwin's rhea is not in danger. A feral population of the greater rhea in Germany appears to be growing.</p>
